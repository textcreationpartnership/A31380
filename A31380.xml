         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>And for the firſt Day upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Aſhes.</head>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou art Duſt, and to Duſt thou ſhall return,</hi> Gen. 3.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an excellent way to begin Lent with the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of duſt, whereby Nature gives us beginning and by the ſame, Death ſhall put an end to all our worldly vanities. There is no better way to abate and humble the proudeſt of all Creatures, then to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his beginning and his end. The middle-part of our life (like a kind of <hi>Proteus</hi>) takes up on it ſeverall ſhapes not underſtood by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but the firſt and laſt part of it deceive no man; for they do both begin and end in Duſt. It is a ſtrange thing that Man, knowing well what he hath been and what he muſt be, is not confounded in himſelf, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the pride of his own life, and the great diſorder of his paſſions. The end of all other creatures is leſs deformed then that of man: Plants in their death retain ſome pleaſing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103432:7"/>ſmell of their bodies: The little roſe buries it ſelf in her naturall ſweetneſſe, and carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion colour. Many Creatures at their death leave us their teeth, horns, feathers, skins, of which we make great uſe. Others after death are ſerved up in ſilver and golden diſhes, to feed the geateſt perſons of the world. Onely mans dead carcaſe is good for nothing but to feed worms: and yet he often retains the preſumptuous pride of a Giant, by the exorbitance of his heart, and the cruell nature of a murderer, by the furious rage of his revenge. Surely that man muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſtupid by nature, or moſt wicked by his own election, who will not correct and amend himſelf, having ſtill before his eyes aſhes for his glaſſe, and death for his miſtres.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This conſideration of Duſt is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent remedy to cure vices, and an aſſured Rampire againſt all temptations. S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> ſaith excellently well; That holy <hi>Iob</hi> was free from all temptations when he was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the ſmoke and duſt of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He that lies upon the ground can fall no lower; but may contemplate all above him, and meditate how to raiſe himſelf by the hand of God, which pulls down the proud and exalts the humble. Is a man tempted with pride? The conſideration of Aſhes will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him. Is he burned with wanton love (which is a direct fire?) But fire cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103432:7"/>Aſhes. Is he perſecuted with cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs? Aſhes do make the greateſt Leeches and Bloud-Suckers caſt their Gorges. Every thing gives way to this unvalued thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is pleaſed to draw the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his power out of the objects of our infirmities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we knew how to uſe rightly the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of death, we ſhould there find the ſtreames of life: All the world together is of no eſtimation to him, that rightly knows the true value of a juſt mans death. It would be neceſſary that they who are taken with the curioſity of Tulips, ſhould ſet in their Gardens a Plant called Napell, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a flower that moſt perfectly reſembles a Deaths head. And if the other Tulips do pleaſe their ſenſes, that will inſtruct their reaſon. Before our laſt death we ſhould die many other deaths; by forſaking all thoſe creatures and affections which lead us to ſin. We ſhould reſemble thoſe creatures (ſacred to the Egyptians) called <hi>Cynocepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> which died piece-meal, and were buried long before their death: So ſhould we bury all our concupiſcences before we go to the grave, and ſtrive to live ſo, that when death comes, he ſhould find very little buſineſſe with us.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. OUr whole Salvation conſiſts in two principals; The one is in our being ſenſible of God, &amp; the other in our moving toward him; the firſt proceeds from faith, the other comes of charity &amp; other virtues. O what a happy thing it is to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this good Centurion, by having ſuch elevated thoughts of the Divinity, and to know nothing of God but what he is: To behold our heavenly father, within this great family of the world, who effects all things by his ſingle word; Creates by his power; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns by his councell; &amp; orders by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this great univerſality of all things. The moſt inſenſible creatures have ears to hear him. Feavers and tempeſts are part of that running camp, which marcheth under his Standard; They advance and retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the ſhadow of his command: he onely hath power to give meaſures to the heavens, bounds to the ſea; to joyn the eaſt and weſt together in an inſtant, and to be in all places where his pleaſure is underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. O how goodly a thing it is to go unto him, like this great Captain: To go ſaid I? Nay rather to flie as he doth by the two wings of charity and humility. His charity made him have a tender care of his poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant &amp; to eſteem his health more dear, then great men do the rareſt pieces in their Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103432:11"/>He doth not truſt his ſervants, but take the charge upon himſelfe: making himſelf (by the power of love) a ſervant to him, who by birth was made ſubject to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. What can be ſaid of ſo many Maſters and Miſtreſſes now adayes, who live alwayes ſlaves to their paſſions? having no care at all of the Salvation, health or neceſſities of their ſervants, as if they were nothing elſe but the ſcumme of the world. They make great uſe of their labours and ſervice (which is juſt) but neglect their bodies, and kill their ſoules by the infection of their wicked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, Mark the humility of this ſouldier, who doth not thinke his houſe worthy to be enlightened by one ſole Glimpſe of our bleſſed Saviours preſence. By the words of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> we may ſay, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy by believing and declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo unworthy: yea worthy that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhould enter not only into his houſe but into his very ſoul. And upon the matter he could not have ſpoken with ſuch faith and humility if he had not firſt encloſed (in his heart) him whom he durſt not receive into his houſe.</p>

If you ſpeak courteouſly to them, they anſwer churliſhly; and in the ſame proportion wherein you are good, you make them wicked; therefore we muſt be carefull that we be not ſo toward God. Many are diſtaſted with devotion, as the Iſraelites were with Manna: All which is good doth diſpleaſe them becauſe it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: And you ſhall finde ſome who (like naughty grounds) caſt up thorns where ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are planted.

                  <p n="1">1. A Man that loves nothing but according to his natural inclination, loves onely like a beaſt or an infidel. The beſt ſort of love is that which is commanded by God, &amp; is derived from judgement, conducted by reaſon and perfected by Charity. Me thinks it ſhould be harder for a good Chriſtian to hate then love his enemy. Hate makes him our equal, whereas love placeth us quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him. By hating a mans enemy, he breaks the laws of God; he fights againſt the Incarnation of Chriſt, wich was acted to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite all things in the bands of love: he gives the lie to the moſt bleſſed Euchariſt, whoſe nature is to make the hearts of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the ſame: he lives (like another Cain in the world) alwayes diſquieted by ſeeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and it is a very death to him to hear of another mans proſperity. Whereas to love an enemy doth not bind us to love the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he hath done us; for we muſt not conſider him as a malefactour, but as a man of our own nature, as he is the Image of God, and as he is a Chriſtian. God doth onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand perfect things, not impoſſible. That which is very hard to flesh and bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes eaſie by the help of grace and reaſon. Our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt being the Father of all harmony can and doth recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile all contrarieties at his will and pleaſure.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. If revenge ſeem ſweet, the gaining of it is moſt bitter: But there is nothing in the world more profitable then to pardon an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy by imitation of our Saviour. For it is then that our conſcience can aſſure us to be the children of God, and inheritors of his glory. We muſt not fear to be deſpiſed for eſteeming virtue, for ſuch contempt can only proceed from thoſe who know not the true value of that glory which belongs to the juſt. There is no better way to revenge then leave it to God, who alwayes doth his own buſineſs. Ween <hi>David</hi> wept for <hi>Saul</hi> who was his enemy, his Clemency did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly make degrees, by which he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the throne of <hi>Iudah.</hi> A good work which comes from the ſpirit of vanity is like an emptied Mine, good for nothing. God who is inviſible, would have our aſpects turned alwayes toward him, and blind tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the world. Alms given by the ſound of a Trumpet, makes a great noiſe on the earth, but reaps little fruit in heaven. The fly of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is a miſchievous thing which deſtroyes all the perfumes of charity. What need we any ſpectators of our good works, every place is full where God is, and where he is not, there onely is Solitude.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103432:19"/>of Gods judgement, joyned with the great uncertainty of the hour of our death? It is an unchangeable decree, that we muſt all be preſented before the high Tribunall of the living God, to render a juſt account of all which our ſoul hath done, while it was joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our body, as we are taught by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> We muſt make an account of our time ſpent, of our thoughts, words, actions, of that we have done, and that we have omitted, of life, death, and of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; and thereupon receive a judgement of everlaſting life or death. All men know that this muſt certainely be done, but no man knows the hour or moment when it ſhall be. So many clocks ſtrike about us every day, &amp; yet none can let us know the hour of our death.</p>

He doth very lively intereſt himſelf in the goods of His heavenly Father, and chaſeth out every prophane thing out of that ſacred place to give thereby glory to the living God, and to put all things in order. It is a vvicked ſtain to Religion vvhen Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſons are vicious and vvhen Churches are prophaned. Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſai h, that prieſts are the heart of the Church, but vvhen they are vvicked they turn all into ſin. A decaying tree hath alvvayes ſome ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity about the root; ſo vvhen any people are vvithout diſcipline, the paſtours are vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out virtue.

                  <p n="2">2. His Houſe (ſaith he) is a houſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but your heart ſhould be the ſanctuary and your lips the door. So long as you are vvithout the exerciſe of prayer, you ſhall be like a Bee vvithout a ſting, vvhich can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103432:22"/>make neither honey nor wax. Prayer is the chiefeſt and moſt effectuall means of that Angelicall converſation to which God calls us, by the merits of his paſſion, and by the effects of his triumphant reſurrection. It is the ſacred buſineſſe which man hath with God, and (to ſpeak with Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>) it is the art to make our ſouls divine. Before all things you muſt put into an order, the number, the time, the place, the manner of your prayers; and be ſure that you pay unto God this tribute with reſpect, ferver, and perſeverance. But if you deſire to make a very good prayer, learn betimes to make a prayer of all your life. Incenſe hath no ſmell without fire, and prayer is of no force without charity. A man muſt converſe innocently, purely with men, that deſires to Treat worthily with God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis a very ill ſign when we deſire ſigns to make us believe in God. The ſigns which we demand to fortifie out faith are ofttimes marks of our infidelity. There is not a more dangerous plague in the events of worldly affairs then to deal with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or to caſt nativities. All theſe things fil men whith more ſaults then knowledge. For divine Oracles have more need to be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced then interpreted. He that will find God muſt ſeek him with ſimplicity, and profeſſe him with piety.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some require a ſign, and yet between heaven and earth, all is full of ſigns. How many creatures ſoever there are, they are all ſteps and characters of the Divinity. What a happy thing it is to ſtudy what God is by the volume of time, and by that great Book of the world. There is not ſo ſmall a floure of the meddows, nor ſo little a creature upon earth, which doth not tell us ſome news of him. He ſpeaks in our ears by all creatures, which are ſo many Organ-pipes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103432:24"/>his Spirit and voice to us. But he hath no ſign ſo great, as the word incarnate which carries all the types of his glory and power.

                  <p n="3">3. Are we not very miſerable ſince we know not our own good but by the loſſe of it, which makes us eſteem ſo little of thoſe things we have in our hands?

Too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is mother of an approaching danger: A man muſt keep himſelf from relapſes which are worſe then ſinnes, which are the greateſt evils of the world; he that loves danger ſhall periſh in it. The firſt ſinne brings with it one Devil, but the ſecond brings ſeven: There are ſome who vomit up their ſinnes as the ſea doth cockles to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them again.

For as boild water doth ſooneſt freez, becauſe the cold works upon it with the greater force; ſo thoſe little fervours of devotion, which an unfaithfull ſoul feels in confeſſions, and receiving (if it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute quite to forſake wickedneſſe) ſerve for nothing elſe but to provoke the wicked ſpirit, to make a new impreſſion upon her: It is then we have moſt reaſon to fear Gods juſtice, when we deſpiſe his mercy.

In theſe lay a great multitude of ſick perſons, of blind, lame, withered, expecting the ſtirring of the water.

The ſick man anſwered him, Lord, I have no man, when

And forthwith he was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the Sabbath that day. The Iews therefore ſaid to him that was healed, it is the Sabbath, thou mayeſt not take up thy bed. He anſwered them, he that made me whole, he ſaid to me, take up thy bed, and walk. They asked him therefore, What is that man that ſaid to thee, take up thy bed and walk? But he that was made whole, knew not who it was. For Ieſus ſhrunk aſide from the multitude ſtanding in the place. Afterward Ieſus findeth him in the temple, and ſaid to him. Behold thou art made whole: ſin no more, leſt ſome worſe thing chance to thee. That man went his way, and told the Iews that it was Ieſus that made him whole.</hi>

The Angels of earth vvhich govern our fortunes goe not ſo faſt as our deſires. But Ieſus vvho is the great Angell of councell, is alwaies ready to cure our maladies; to ſupport our weakneſſe, and make perfect our virtues. We need only
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103432:28"/>to follow his motions and inſpirations, to meet with everlaſting reſt. It is a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, that ſome can patiently expect the barren favours of men twenty or thirty years together, and yet will not continue three dayes in prayer to ſeek the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable graces of God.</p>

Men generally do all what they can poſſibly to cure their corporal infirmities; they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide a thouſand vexations (which are but too certain) to recover a health which is moſt uncertain. And as for the paſſions of the mind, ſome love the Feavers of their own love, &amp; their worldly ambition above their own life. They ſuck the head of a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous aſpick, &amp; are killed by the tongue of a viper. They will not part with that which kills them; and if you take from them the worm which makes them itch, or the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner who doth indeed torment them, they believe you take away the chiefeſt of their felicity.

And as he was yet ſpeaking, behold a bright cloud overſhadowed them. And loe, a voice out of the Cloud, ſaying, This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him. And the Diſciples hearing it, fell upon their face, and were ſore afraid. And Ieſus

The mountain which before was a den for Tigers and Panthers (according to the Story) is now beautified by our Saviour, and becomes a place full of ſweetneſs and raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Jeſus appears transfigured in the high robes of his glory. The cloud made him a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion of gold, &amp; the Sun made his face ſhine like it ſelf. The heavenly Father doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Son as the true Prince of glory; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> both appear in brightneſs, the one bearing the Tables of the Law, and the other carried in a burning Chariot (as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, which made the Apoſtles know him.

Let us rely upon the word (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) which remains for ever, while men paſſe like the water of a fountain, which hides it ſelf in the Spring, shews it ſelf in the ſtream, and loſeth it ſelf at laſt in the Sea. But God is alwayes himſelf, there needs no Tabernacle made by the hands of man, to remain with him; for in Paradiſe, he is both the God and the Temple.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103432:34"/>without a foundation, a tree without a root, a veſſell move upon the ſea without a bottome, and an excellent clock without a ſpring. For the ſame which the foundation is to a houſe, the root to a tree, the bottome to a ſhip, and the ſpring to a clock, the ſame is a mans inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour life to all virtue.

He that ſows wind (ſaith the Prophet) ſhall reape a ſtorm. Let us live to our ſelves in the purity of a good conſcience, and of a perfect humility; if we deſire to live for ever with God. Thoſe ſhadowes of falſe devotion proceed from the leaves of that figtree, wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> covered their nakedneſſe: do not we know that hyprocriſie is the ſame thing to virtue, which painting is to faces? and that it is the very moth which devours ſanctity, and will at the day of judgement make all thoſe appear naked, which to the world ſeem well apparelled.</p>

We fear every thing like mortall men, and yet deſire all, as if we ſhould be immortall upon earth. It is a ſtrange thing to obſerve how the deſire of honour ſlides even amongſt the moſt refined devotions. Some one is counted an Angell of heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, who hath not forſaken his pretences upon earth. Ambition ſleeps in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103432:36"/>the boſomes of perſons conſecrated for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars. It overthrowes ſome whom luxury could not ſtir; and moves thoſe whom avarice could not touch. We deſire all to be known, and to ſeem what we are not: but this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is that which doth bewitch us. All paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grow old and weaker by age; only the deſire of worldly riches &amp; honours, is a ſhirt which we never put off till we come to the grave. Why do we ſo extremely torment our poor life, by running after this ſhadow of honour, which we cannot follow without trouble, nor poſſeſſe without fear, nor loſe without ſorrow? Is it not aſtrange folly that men love ſuch vanities till the very laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their own ruines, and fear nothing, ſo they may tumble into precipices of gold and ſilver?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What great paines you take for theſe children, as if they did not more belong to God then you: you caſt day and night where to place them when the providence of God (which is the great Harbinger of the world) hath already markt their lodgings. One is ſettled in a good Religious courſe, another in the grave, another perhaps ſhall have more then is neceſſary to make him a good man. <hi>Eve</hi> imagined that her ſonne <hi>Cain</hi> (having all the world) would have become ſome great God, when ambition made him a devil incarnate.

They both meet in the other world, the one in a gulf of fire, the other in an Abyſs of delights: Their ends are as different as their lives were contrary: to teach us that he which ſhall conſider rightly, the end of all worldly ſins and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will have in horrour the deſire of them. And as there is nothing, for which godly poor men may not hope, ſo is there nothing which wicked rich men ſhould not fear.

It concealed poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> &amp; kept him in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, like the fiſh which we never ſee till it be dead. But Jeſus draws the curtain, and makes himſelf the hiſtorian of this good poor man, ſhewing us the ſtate of his ſoul, of his body, of his life &amp; death. He makes him appear in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome as within the temple of reſt and happineſs, and makes him known to the rich man as to the treaſurer of hells riches. Are not we unworthy the name
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103432:38"/>which we carry, when we deſpiſe the poor, and hate poverty as the greateſt miſery? ſince the Sonne of God having once conſecrated it upon the throne of his Manger, made it ſerve for his ſpouſe during life, and his bride maid at the time of his death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This rich glutton dreamed, and at the end of his dream found himſelf buried in hell. All thoſe pomps of his life were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in an inſtant as ſo many nocturnall il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, and his heart filled with eternall grief and torment. His firſt miſery is a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, unexpected and hideous change from a huge ſea of delicacies, into an unſufferable gulf of fire: where he doth acknowledge that one of the greateſt vexations in miſery is to have been happy. Another diſaſter which afflicts him, is to ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, to teach us that the damned are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by Paradiſe, even to the very loweſt par of Hell; and that the moſt grievous of their torments is, they can never forget their loſſe of God, So ſaith <hi>Theophilact</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was placed over againſt the terreſtriall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe from whence he was baniſhed, that in his very puniſhment he might ſee the happineſſe he had loſt by his foul fault.

Do good with thoſe goods which God hath given you, and ſuffer them not to make you wicked; but employ your riches by the hands of virtue: If gold be a child of the Sun, why doe you hide him from his father? God choſe the boſome of rich <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be the Paradiſe of poor <hi>Lazarus.</hi> So may you make the needy feel happineſſe by your bounty; your riches ſhall raiſe you up, when they are troden under your feet.

               <p>ANother Parable hear ye: A man there was, an houſholder, who planted a Vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and digged in it a preſſe, and builded a Tower, and let it out to Husbandmen, and went forth into a ſtrange Countrey. And when the time of fruis drew, nigh, he ſent his ſervants to the Husbandmen, to receive the fruits thereof. And the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men apprehending his ſervants, one they beat,

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he ſent other ſervants more then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and they did to them likewiſe. And laſt of all he ſent to them his Son, ſaying, They will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence my Son. But the Husbandmen ſeeing the Son, ſaid within themſelves, This is the heir, come let us kill him, and we ſhall have his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. And apprehending him, they caſt him forth out of the Vineyard, and killed him. When therefore the Lord of the Vineyard ſhall come, what will he doe to thoſe Husbandmen? They ſay to him, The naughty men he will bring to nought: and his Vineyard he will let out to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Husbandmen, that ſhall render him the fruits of their ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>Ieſus ſaith to them, have you never read in the Scriptures, The ſtone which the builders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the ſame is made into the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?

We have reaſon to fear all that is in us, yea even the gifts of God: All his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are ſo many chains; If they bind us not to doe our duty, they will bind us to the puniſhment due for that neglect. Our ſoul is given us by God as a thing borrowed from heaven, we muſt not be too prodigall of it. We muſt dig up ill roots as we doe in land cultivated: The time will come, that we muſt render up the fruits; &amp; ſhall we then preſent thorns? Examine every day how you profit, and what you doe: draw every day a line, but draw it toward eternity. What can you hide from God who knows all? What can you repay to God who gives all? and how can you requite Jeſus who hath given himſelf?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How many meſſengers doth God ſend to our hearts without intermiſſion, and how many inſpirations which we reject? So many Sermons which we do not obſerve, &amp; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples which we neglect. Jeſus comes in perſon by the Scrament of the Altar, and we drive him from us, to crucifie him, when we place the Devil and Mortall ſin in his room. What other thing can we expect for reward of all theſe violences, but a moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſtruction, if ye do not prevent the ſword of juſtice, by walking in the paths of mercy? Our vanities which at firſt are like ſmall threds, by the contempt of Gods grace, come

God hangs clouds over it, but will let no drop of water fall upon it. The Sun never looks upon it with a loving eye: all there, is barren, venemous, and near to hell. Therefore above all things we muſt fear to be forſaken of God. Mercy provoked, changes it ſelf into ſevere Juſtice. All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will ſerve (as Gods inſtruments) to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a fugitive ſoul, which flies from him by her ingratitude, when he drawes her to him by the ſweetneſſe of his benefits.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THis parable is a true table expreſſing the excurſions of a prodigall ſoul and her return to the mercy of God by the way of repentance. Note that the firſt ſtep which ſhe trode toward her own deſtruction (as <hi>Cain</hi> did) was her departing from God, not by changing of place, but of heart. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the chiefeſt light, which made it fall into an eclipſe of reaſon and ſo into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found darkneſſe. She diverted her ſelf from the greateſt bounty, which made her encline toward all wickedneſſe (being ſtrayed from her ſoveraign being) which made her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come juſt nothing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. She continued in ſinne, as in a countrey which was juſt nothing, where ſhe was vexed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103432:43"/>on all ſides with diſquiet, with cares, with fears and diſcontents. All ſins toſſe their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, as the ball is toſſed at Baloon. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſends them to pride: pride to violence; violence to avarice: avarice to ambition, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to pomp and riot: pomp to gluttony: gluttony to luxury: luxury to idleneſſe: idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to contempt and poverty, and that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty brings them to all worldly miſery. For all miſchiefs follow a wicked ſoul which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God thinks to find a better condition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Affliction opens the eyes of man, and makes him come to himſelf that he may the better return to God. There is no journey ſo farre as when a man departs from himſelf not by place but by manners, A ſea of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe interpoſeth it ſelf between his ſoul and innocence, to divorce her from the way of goodneſſe: But Gods grace is a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind, which dries it up; and having brought man to himſelf, takes him by the hand and leads him even to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. O what a happy thing it is to conſider the effects of Gods mercy in the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good father to his prodigall ſon: The one had loſt all which he had of a good ſonne: but the other had not loſt what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a good father. The ſonne had yet ſaid nothing, when fatherly affection pleaded for him in the heart of his father; who felt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103432:43"/>the dolours of a ſpirituall labour; and his entrails were moved to give a ſecond birth to his ſonne. Though he were old, yet he went the pace of a young man: Charity gives him wings to flie to the embracements of his loſt child. He is moſt joyfull of all that comes with him, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his very poverty. This with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ſhould give us a marvellous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Gods mercy, when we ſeek it with hearty repentance. It is a ſea of bounty which waſheth away all that is amiſſe. Since he hath changed the name of maſter into that of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will rather command by love, then raign by a predominant power. No man ought to diſpair of pardon except he, who can be as fully wicked as God is good, none is ſo mercifull as God, none is ſo good a father as he: for when you may have loſt your part of all his virtues, you can never (while you live) loſe the poſſibility of his mercy. He will receive you between his arms without any other reaſon but your return by repentance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſame Parable is alſo a true glaſſe ſhewing the life of thoſe young unthriſts, who think they are born onely for ſport, for their bellies and for pleaſure. They imagine their fathers keep for them the golden mines of Peru; and their life being without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, their expences are without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Some of them runne through the world; they wander into all places, but never enter
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103432:44"/>into conſideration of themſelves. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from forain parts, loden with debts, and bring home nothing but ſome new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall faſhions, irps, cringes, and coran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes. There are many of them in whom pride and miſery continue inſeparable, after they have loſt their money and their brains. Their fathers are cauſes of their faults, by gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo much wealth for thoſe, who know not how to uſe it. Yet if they have the true repentance of the prodigall child, he muſt not deny them pardon: But mercy muſt not be had of thoſe who ask it by ſtrong hand, or ſeek it by a counterfeit ſorrow.</p>

The world doth now furniſh it ſelf with ſuch like devotions. Some make it a ſin to look upon a fair flower with delight: to eat with a good appetite: to drink cool wine in hot weather: to burn a paper, upon which the name of Ieſus is written: to tread upon two ſtraws that lie a croſs. But to ſet mony to uſury, to remember injuries for ever to keep a poor workmans wages, to oppreſs the weak, to accuſe the innocent, to ſpoil mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable perſons: Theſe are the little ſins which paſs for virtues in this world.

A Soul within a ſick body, is a Princeſſe that dwels in a ruinous houſe: Health is the beſt of all temporall goods; without which all honors are as the beams of an eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sun: Riches are unpleaſing, and all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are languiſhing. All joy of the heart ſubſiſts naturally in the health of the body. But yet it is true, that the moſt healthfull perſons are not alwaies the moſt holy. What profit is there in that health, which ſerves for a provocation to ſinne, for an inticement to worldly pleaſure, and a gate to death? The beſt ſouls are never better nor ſtronger, then when their bodies are ſick: their diſeaſes are too hard for their mortall bodies, but their courage is invincible. It is a great knovvledge to underſtand our own infirmities. Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity keeps us from the view of them, but adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſhews them to us. We ſhould hardly know what death is, if ſo many diſeaſes did not teach us every day that we are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. <hi>Semiramis</hi> the proudeſt of all Queens had made a law whereby ſhe was to be adored
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103432:54"/>in ſtead of all the gods, but being humbled by a great ſickneſſe, ſhe acknowledged her ſelf to be but a woman.</p>

She leaves all to God, who is only Maſter of life and death. She knew that he which gives his benefits with ſuch bounty, hath the wiſdome to chuſe thoſe which are moſt fit for us. How do we know whether we deſiring to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from a ſickneſſe, do not aske of God to take away a gift which is very neceſſary to our ſalvation? That malady or affliction which makes us diſtaſte worldly pleaſures, gives us a diſpoſition to taſte the joyes of heaven.</p>

That body which carried all the marks of death in the face, is no ſooner grown ſtrong by health (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth the heart &amp; fils the vains with bloud) but it becomes a ſlave to ſin. The gifts of God (being abuſed) ſerve for nothing but to make it wicked, and ſo the ſoul is killed by recovery of the fleſh. But this pious woman is no ſooner on foot but ſhe ſerves the Author of life and employes all thoſe limbs, (which Jeſus cured of the Feaver) to prepare ſome proviſions to refreſh him. He that will not uſe

When a man is recovered from a great ſickneſſe, as his body is renewed by health, ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, he ſhould renew his ſpirit by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The body (ſaith Saint <hi>Maximus</hi>) is the bed of the ſoul, where it ſleeps too eaſily in continuall health, and forgets it ſelf in many things.

And after they were filled, he ſaid to his Diſciples, Gather the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are remaining leſt they be loſt.

See how he carried himſelf toward this poor multitude which followed him with ſuch zeal and conſtancy. It ſeems they were his children, that he carried them all upon his ſhoulders, that he had their names, their Countreys, their qualities, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their ſmall fortunes graven in his heart. He is ſo tender over them, he ſo afflicts himſelf about them, as a Shepheard over his poor flock. He inſtructs them, he ſpeaks to them of heavenly things, he heals their mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he comforts their ſadneſſe, he lifts his eyes up to heaven for them; and for them he opens his divine hands (the treaſures of Heaven) and nouriſhes them by a miracle, as they had wholly reſigned themſelves to him with ſuch abſolute confidence. O how are we cheriſhed by heaven, ſince God doth bind himſelf to help us! And we ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull not to truſt him, who makes nature it ſelf ſo faithfull to us. It is here much to be obſerved, that God doth no miracles for his own profit; he doth not change ſtones into bread in the Deſart to nouriſh himſelf after that long faſt which he did there make; but for his faithfull ſervants he alters the courſe of nature, and being auſtere to himſelf, he becomes indulgent to us; to teach us, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103432:61"/>we ſhould diſpoyl our ſelves of ſelf-love, which ties us to our own fleſh, and makes us ſo negligent to our neighbour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What precious thing is to be gotten by following the world, that we ſhould forſake Jeſus in the Deſart, and run after vain hopes at Court, and great mens houſes, where we pretend to make ſome fortune? how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries muſt a man diſſemble? how many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts muſt he ſwallow? how many deadly ſweats muſt he endure to obtain ſome reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable condition? how many times muſt he ſacrifice his children, engage his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; offer violences to others to advance the affairs of great men?

It is quite contrary in the ſervice of God: for he encourages our virtues, he ſupplies our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, governs our ſpirituall, and yet neglects not our temporal occaſions. He that cloathes the flowers of the Meadows more gorgeouſly then Monarchs, who lodges ſo many little Fiſhes in golden &amp; azure ſhells, he who doth

But yet we find all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world to put our truſt in him, we villifie our cares of eternitie: and by ſeeking after worldly things whereby to live, we tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our ſelves, and in the end loſe our own lives. A man that muſt die, needs very few worldly things; a very little Cabbin will ſuffice nature, but whole Kingdomes will not ſatisfie covetouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Jeſus flies from Scepters, and runs to the Croſſe; he would have no worldly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, becauſe their Thrones are made of Ice, and their Crowns of Glaſſe. He valued the Kingdome of God above all things, that he night make us partakers of his precious conqueſt; and infinite rich prize.

Alas! doe we know better then God, in what honour conſiſts, that we muſt ſeek after that which he did avoid, and not imitate that which he followed?</p>
                  <p>Let us follow God, and believe that where he is there can be no deſart or ſolitude for

All worldly pleaſures are Comets made fat with the ſmoaks and vapours of the earth; and in ſtead of giving light and brightneſſe, they bring forth murders and contagions: but the following of God is alwayes ſweet, and he which ſuffers thereby, changes his very tears into nouriſhment.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103432:65"/>it, and make our illuſions voluntary. The Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> adviſeth us to uſe our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as men do leaven to ſeaſon bread. Al the objects preſented to our imaginations, which we eſteem are fading, if we do not adde ſome heavenly vigour to help our judgement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To judge according to apparences is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great want both of judgement and courage. The firſt makes us preferre vanity before truth; the ſecond gives that to ſilk and gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en clothes, which is properly due to virtue: We adore painted coles and certain dark ſumes covered outwardly with ſnow; But if we did know how many great miſeries and what beaſtly ordure is hidden unde cloth of gold, ſilk, and ſcarlet, we would complain of our eyes for being ſo farre without reaſon. It is a kind of Apoſtacy and rebellion againſt Gods providence, to judge without calling God to be a preſident in our counſell; or to take in hand any humane inventions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God is pleaſed to lodge pearls within cockles; and beſtows his treaſures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and virtue, many times upon perſons, who have the moſt unfaſhionable outſides, to countercheck humane wiſdome. He makes his oratour of thoſe who are ſpeechleſſe; and numbers of frogs and flies to overthrow mighty armies. He makes Kings out of shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and ſerves himſelf of things which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103432:66"/>are not, as if they were. The moſt pleaſing Sacrifice which he receives upon earth, is from the humble; and when we deſpiſe thoſe, we divert the honours of God. We offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the worlds opinion, like the Sages of Egypt; who did light candles and burn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to Crocodiles. The Jewes loſt their faith to follow apparences: and there is no ſhorter way to Apoſtacy then to adore the world and neglect God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. An ill opinion make folks many times paſſe a raſh judgement: They mount into Gods chair to judge the hearts of men: The chaſte Doves are uſed like Ravens, and Ravens like Swans. Opinion puts falſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles upon our eyes, which make faults ſeem virtues, and virtues crimes. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe we ſhould think that virtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will not conceive an ill ſuſpition of their neighbour without a very ſure ground: St. <hi>Iohn Climachus</hi> ſaith, fire is no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to water, then raſh judgement is to the ſtate of repentance. It is a certain ſign, that we doe not ſee our own ſins, when we ſeek curiouſly after the leaſt defects of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. If we would but once enter into our ſelves, we ſhould be ſo buſie to lament our own lives, that we ſhould not have time to cenſure thoſe of others.</p>

I muſt work the works of him that ſent me whiles it is day, the night cometh when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

As he heard therefore that he was ſick, then he tarried in the ſame place two dayes: Then after this he ſaith to his Diſciples, Let us go into Iewry again.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103432:72"/>The Diſciples ſay to him, Rabbi, now the Iewes ſought to ſtone thee, and goeſt thou thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? Ieſus anſwered, Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he ſtumbleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the light of this world: but if he walk in the night, he ſtumbleth, becauſe the light is not in him. Theſe things he ſaid: and after this he ſaith to them, Lazarus our friend ſleepeth; but I go that I may raiſe him from ſleep. His Diſciples therefore ſaid, Lord, if he ſleep, he ſhall be ſafe. But Ieſus ſpake of his death, and they thought that he ſpake of the ſleeping of ſleep. Then therefore Ieſus ſaïd to them plainly, Lazarus is dead, and I am glad for your ſake, that you may believe, becauſe I was not there: but let us go to him. Thomas therefore who called Didymus, ſaid to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciples, Let us alſo go, to die with him. Ieſus therefore came, and found him now, having been four dayes in the grave. And Bethania was nigh to Ieruſalem, about fifteen furlongs. And many of the Iewes were come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother. Martha therefore when ſhe heard that Ieſus was come, went to meet him: but Mary ſate at home. Martha therefore ſaid to Ieſus, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died. But now alſo I know, that what things ſoever thou ſhalt ask of God, God will give thee. Ieſus ſaith to her, Thy brother ſhall riſe again. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha ſaith to him, I know that he ſhall riſe again
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103432:73"/>in the reſurrection in the laſt day. Ieſus ſaid to her, I am the reſurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, ſhall live. And every one that liveth and believeth in me, ſhall not die for ever. Believeſt thou this? She ſaid to him, Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Chriſt the Son of God, that art come into this world.</hi>

                  <p>ONe of the greateſt Tragedies acted in the life of man, which makes curious perſons to queſtion, wiſe men to wonder, good men to groan, and the wicked to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice; is to ſee an innocent man oppreſſed by colour of juſtice. Now Ieſus being reſolved to eſpouſe our miſeries, as far as they can reach, was pleaſed to paſſe through thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours and formalities of the wicked, colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a pretext of equity. He is not here condemned by a mean people without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, without power, without formality of proceſſe: But by theſe chief Prieſts and principall men of that Nation aſſembled in Councell; they informed themſelves, they reaſon, and conclude his death. The Lions of <hi>Solomons</hi> throne, did anciently bear certain Writs of the Law, to ſignifie that it was to be handled by couragious and clear ſeeing Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But here Foxes got it into their hands, and did manage it by crafty deceits &amp; wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. Alas we are far from the Laws of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103432:89"/>God, when we cannot abide the leaſt word ſpoken againſt our reputation. We are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſuffer for innocency, as if it were a greater honour to ſuffer for a direct offence. Shall we never think that the triumph of virtue conſiſts in well doing, and (thereby) ſometimes receiving harm even from thoſe who are eſteemed good men?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are ſome difficulties in affairs where truth is ſhut up as within a cloud. Wiſe men can hardly find out where the point lies, but God doth ſo order it that falſhood leaves alwayes certain marks by which it may be known; and the beauty of truth, is ever like that lake of Affrick, which early or late diſcovers all that is caſt into it, and makes all impoſtures plainly appear, when we think they are moſt conceald. And this appears by the proceeding of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> who choſe to condemn Chriſt, for thoſe things which were the certain tokens that he was the true Meſſias. He concluded his death by reaſon of his miracles, and thoſe gave him authority as to the prince of Iſfe. A trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpirit makes darts of every thing (which it can) to fight againſt reaſon, and kills it ſelf, not ſuſpecting its own poiſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Devil publiſheth Ieſus for the true Meſſias and ſo doth likewiſe <hi>Caiphas</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy the ſame. It is not alwayes a certain mark of goodneſſe, to ſpeak that which is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103432:89"/>good, but it is an aſſurance of virtue to avoid that which is ill. There are many from whom good works do eſcape, while they both think and do ill. Truth makes uſe of their tongues, when Devils command their hearts. It is this which makes us ſee our Saviours Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the extent of his conqueſts, which is not limited by time, he being already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into poſſeſſon of eternity: and it is not bounded by place, becauſe it contains all Immenſity.

There is a very great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: for the love of worldy men, playes the Tyrant in the world; ſnatching &amp; turning all things from the true ſcope and intention for which they were made by God, diverting them to prophane uſes, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and forcible wayes.

And if by chance it love any creature, with a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhing love, and as it ought to be loved, that is not permanent.

He prevents the bath of his bloud, by the bath of an element: which he doth expreſly before his inſtitution of the bleſſed Sacrament to teach us, what purity of life, of heart, of faith, of in ention and affections we muſt bring to the holy Euchariſt. It is neceſſary to chaſe away all ſtrange gods (which are ſins and paſſions) before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the God of Iſrael: we muſt waſh our ſelves in the waters of repentance, &amp; change our attire by a new converſation.

There were three marvelous agonies, of God &amp; Death; of Ioy and Sorrow; of the Soul and Fleſh of Ieſus.

                  <p>The joy of beatitude was a fruition of all celeſtial delights, whereunto nothing which diſpleaſed could have acceſſe; and yet Ieſus ſuffered ſorrow, to give him a mortal blow even in the Sanctuary of his Divinity.

                  <p>To be ſhort, there was a great duel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the affectionate love, and the virginal fleſh of Ieſus. His ſoul did naturally love a body which was ſo obedient; and his bodie followed wholly the inclinations of his ſoul: There was ſo perfect an agreement between theſe two parties; that their ſeparation muſt needs be moſt dolorous. Yet Ieſus would have it ſo, &amp; ſigne the decree by ſweating
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103432:100"/>bloud. And as if it had been too little to weep for our ſinnes with two eyes, he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as many eyes as he had veins, to be made in his body, to ſhed for us tears of his own bloud.</p>

                  <p>IN that obſcure &amp; dolorous night, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Saviour was apprehended, three ſorts of darkneſſes were caſt; upon the Iews, upon <hi>Iudas,</hi> &amp; upon S. <hi>Peter:</hi> A darkneſs of obduration upon the hearts of the Iews; a darkneſſe of ingratefull malignity upon <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das;</hi> and a darkneſſe of infirmity upon Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> Was there ever any blindneſs like that of the Iews, who ſought for the ſhining ſun with lighted torches, without knowing him by ſo many beams of power which ſhined from him? They are ſtrucken down with the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103432:101"/>voice of the Son of God, as with lightning; and they riſe again upon the earth to arme themſelves againſt heaven. They bind his hands to take away the uſe of his forces, but they could not ſtop the courſe of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. To ſhew that he is totally good, he is good and charitable even amongſt his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs executioners, and he loſt all he had (ſavng his Godhead) only to gain patience.</p>
                  <p>When Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſtroke the high Prieſts ſervant, the patience of our Lord Ieſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the blow, and had no patience till he was healed. If goodneſs did ſhew forth any one beam in the Garden, modeſty ſent forth another in the houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> when his face was ſtrucken by a ſervile hand, his mouth opened it ſelf as a Temple from whence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing came but ſweetneſſe and light. The God of Truth ſpeaketh to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and they ſpit upon his brightneſſe, and cover that face which muſt diſcover heaven for us. The mirrour of Angels is tarniſht with the ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of infernal mouths, &amp; wounded by moſt ſacrilegious hands, without any diſturbance of his conſtancie. That was invincible by his virtue, as the wilfulneſs of the Iews ſtood unmoveable by their obduration. There are ſouls which after they have filled the earth with crimes, expect no cure of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, but by the hell of the reprobate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond darkneſs appeareth by the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103432:102"/>black paſſion of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who falls down into hell with his eys open; and after he had fold his ſoul, ſold Jeſus, and both all he had, and all he was, to buy an infamous halter to hang himſelf. A ſoul become paſſionate with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton love, with ambition or avarice, is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed into it ſelf, as into a direct hell, and delivered to her own paſſion as to the Furies. The Poets <hi>Hydra</hi> had but ſeven heads, but the ſpirit of Avarice (S. <hi>Iohn Climacus</hi> ſaith) hath ten thouſand. The converſation of Ieſus, which was ſo full of infinite attractions, could never win the ſpirit of <hi>Judas,</hi> when it was once bewitched with covetouſneſſe. The tinkling of ſilver kept him from rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Jeſus. He makes uſe of the moſt holy things to betray Holineſs it ſelf. He employes the kiſſe of peace to begin war. He carries poyſon in his heart, and hony in his mouth: he puts on the ſpirit of Ieſus to betray him. This ſhews us plainly, that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and traiterous perſons are fartheſt from God, and neareſt to the Devils.</p>
                  <p>The third power of darkneſſe appeared in the infirmitie of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who after ſo many proteſtations of fidelity, for fear of death, renounced the Authour of life. One of the Ancients ſaid, the greateſt frailty of Humanity was, that the wiſeſt men were not infallibly wiſe at all times. And all men are aſtoniſhed to ſee, that the greateſt ſpirits (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103432:102"/>left to themſelves) become barren, and ſuffer eclipſes which give example to the wiſeſt, and terrour to all the world. God hath ſuffered the fall of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to make us have in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103432:103"/>come in his great Majeſty to judge the world, fire and lightning ſtreaming from his face, and all things trembling under his feet, was pleaſed at this time to be judged as a criminall perſon. Every thing is moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this judgement: The accuſers ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe things, which they had reſolved in their counſels, but all ſpake againſt their conſciences. As ſoon as they are heard, they are condemned; juſtice for ſaketh them, &amp; they are wholly poſſeſt with rage. <hi>Pilate</hi> before he gave judgement upon Ieſus, pronounced it againſt himſelfe: for after he had ſo many times declared him innocent, he could not give judgement without proteſting himſelf to be unjuſt. The ſilence of Ieſus is more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this Infidell, then the eloquence of all the world; and truth without ſpeaking one word triumpheth over falſhood. A Pagan Lady (the wife of Pilate) is more knowing then all the Laws: more religious then the Prieſts, more zealous then the Apoſtles, more couragious then the men of Arms: when ſhe ſleepeth, Ieſus is in her ſleep: when ſhe talketh Ieſus is upon her tongue; if ſhe write, Ieſus i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He appears before <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> as the king of dolours, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for us the king of glories. But what a horrour is it to conſider that in this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was uſed like a ſlave, like a ſorcerer, like an accurſed ſacrifice?

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103432:105"/>which was loſt, and where he makes the Sun to be eclipſed over his head, and ſtones to be cloven under his feet; to teach us by inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creatures, the feeling which we ſhould have of his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>This is the ſchool where Ieſus teacheth that great Leſſon, which is the way to do well: &amp; we cannot better learn it then by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſince he was pleaſed to make himſelf paſſible &amp; motal, to overcome our paſſions, and to be the Author of our immortality.</p>
               <p>The qualities of a good death may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to three points: of which the firſt is to have a right conformity to the will of God, for the manner, the hour and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our death.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is to forſake as well the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as the preſence of all creatures of this baſe world.</p>
               <p>The third is to unite our ſelves to God by the practiſe of great virtues, which will ſerve as ſteps to glory.</p>
               <p>Now theſe three conditions are to be ſeen in the death of the Prince of Glory upon mount Calvry; which we will take as the pureſt Idea's, whereby to regulate our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of this world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. COnſider in the firſt place, that every man living hath a naturall inclination to life, becauſe it hath ſome kind of divinity in it. We love it when it ſmileth upon us,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103432:106"/>as if it were our Paradiſe; and if it be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom, yet we ſtrive to retain it, though it be accompanied with very great miſeries. And if we muſt needs forſake this miſerable body, we then deſire to leave it by ſome gentle and eaſie death. This make thus plainly ſee the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of our Saviour, who being Maſter of life and death, and having it in his power to chuſe that manner of death which would be leaſt hideous, (being of it ſelf full enough of horrour) yet nevertheleſſe, to conform himſelf to the will of his heavenly Father, &amp; to confound our delicacies: he would needs leave his life by the moſt dolorous and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious which was to be found amongſt all the deaths of the whole world. The Croſſe amongſt the Gentiles was a puniſhment for ſlaves, and the moſt deſperate perſons of the whole world. The Croſſe amongſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews was accurſed: It was the ordinary curſe which the moſt uncapable and moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious mouths did pronounce againſt their greateſt enemies, The death of a crucified man, was the moſt continuall, languiſhings and tearing of a ſoul from the body, with moſt exceſſive violence and agony. And yet the eternall wiſdome choſe this kind of puniſhment, and drank all the ſorrows of a cup ſo bitter. He ſhould have died upon ſome Trophee, and breathed out his laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt flowers, &amp; left his ſoul in a moment:

The couragious Mother to triumph over her ſelf by a magnanimous conſtancie, was preſent at the execution of her dear Son. She fixed her eyes upon all his wounds, to engrave them deep in her heart. She opened her ſoul wide to receive that ſharp piercing ſword with which ſhe was threatned by that venerable old <hi>Simeon</hi> at her purification: And Ieſus who ſaw her ſo afflicted for his ſake, felt himſelf doubly crucified, upon the wood of the Croſs, and the heart of his deat Mother.

               <p n="3">3. To conclude, obſerve the third quality of a good death which will declare it ſelf by the exerciſe of great and heroick virtues. Conſider that incomparable mildneſſe which hath aſtoniſhed all ages, hath encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged all virtues, hath condemned all reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hath inſtructed all Schools and crowned all good actions: He was raiſed upon the croſſe, vvhen his dolours were moſt ſharp and piercing: when his wounds did open
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103432:109"/>on all ſides, when his precious bloud ſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and moiſtened it in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; when he ſaw his poor clothes torn in peices, and yet bloudy in the hands of thoſe who crucified him. He conſidered the extreme malice of that cruell people, how thoſe which could not wound him with iron, pierced him with the points of their accurſed tongues. He could quickly have made ſire com down from heaven upon thoſe rebellious heads. And yet forgetting all his pains to remember his mercies, he opened his mouth, and the firſt worde he ſpake was in the favour of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to negotiate their reconciliation, before his ſoul departed. The learned Cardinall <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> admiring the exceſſive charity of our Saviour toward his enemies, applies excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent well that which is ſpoken of the Sunne in Eccleſiaſticus. He brings news to all the world at his riſing, and at noon-day he burns the earth, and heats thoſe furnaces of Nature, which make it produce all her fruits.</p>
               <p>So Jeſus the Sun of the intelligible world, did manifeſt himſelf at his Nativity, as in the morning. But the Croſſe was his bed at noon, from whence came thoſe burning ſtreames of Love, which inflames the hearts of all bleſſed perſons, who are like furnaces of that eternall fire which burns in holy Sion.</p>
               <p>On the other part admire that great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103432:109"/>which held him ſo long upon the Croſſe, as upon a Throne of honour and power when he beſtowed Paradiſe upon a man that was his companion in ſuffering. I cannot tell whether in this action we ſhould more admire the good fortune of the good theif, or the greatneſſe of Jeſus. The happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the good theif, who is drawn for a cut throat to priſon; from priſon to the judgement hall; from thence to the Croſſe; and thence goes to Paradiſe, without needing any other gate but the heart of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, what can be more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then to ſee a man crucified, to do that act, which muſt be performed by the living God, when the world ſhall end? To ſave ſome, to make others reprobate, and to judge from the height of his Croſſe, as if he ſate upon the cheifeſt throne of all Monarchs.</p>
               <p>But we muſt needs affirm that the virtue of patience in this, holds a chief place, and teaches very admirable leſſons. He endures the torments of the body, and the pains of the ſpirit, in all the faculties of his ſoul, in all the parts of his virgin fleſh; and by the cruelty and multiplicity of his wounds, they all become one onely wound, from the ſole of his foot, to the top of his head.</p>
               <p>His delicate body ſuffers moſt innocently, and all, by moſt ingrate and hypocriticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who would colour their vengeance with
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103432:110"/>an apparence of holineſſe. He ſuffers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any comfort at all, and (which is more) without bemoaning himſelf; he ſuffers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they would or could lay upon him, to the very laſt gaſp of his life. Heaven weares mourning upon the Croſs; all the Citizens of heaven weep over his torments; the earth quakes; the ſtones rend themſelves; ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres open; the dead ariſe: Onely Jeſus dies unmoveable upon this throne of patience.</p>
               <p>To conclude, who would not be aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the tranquillity of his ſpirit, &amp; amongſt thoſe great convulſions of the world which moved round about the Croſs, amongſt ſuch bloudy dolours, inſolent cries, &amp; inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able blaſphemies, how he remained upon the Croſſe, as in a Sanctuary at the foot of an Altar; bleeding, weeping, &amp; praying, to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle his prayers with his bloud and tears. I do now underſtand why the Wiſe man ſaid, He planted Iſles within the Abyſſe; ſince that, in ſo great a gulph of afflictions, he ſhewed ſuch a ſerenity of ſpirit; thereby making a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe for his Father (amongſt ſo great pains) by the ſweet perfume of his virtues. After he had prayed for his enemies, given a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Paradiſe to the good thief, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his mother to his Diſciple, he ſhut up his eyes from all humane things, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining himſelf onely with prayers and ſighs to his heavenly Father. O that at
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103432:110"/>the time of our deaths we could imitate the death of Ieſus, and then we ſhould be ſure to find the ſtreams of life.</p>

O my Ieſus, I know not to whom I ſpeak, for I do no more know thee in the ſtate thou now art; or if I do, it is onely by thy miſeries, becauſe they are ſo exceſſive, that there was need of a God to ſuffer what thou haſt indured.

If there appear a difficulty to remove the ſtones, love gives them arms.

We will not know, that the throne of Mount Calvary, is the path way to heaven; and as this truth wanders from our hearts, Jeſus departs from our eyes.

                  <hi>ANd whiles they ſpake theſe things, Ieſus ſtood in the midſt of them, and he ſaith to them, Peace be to you, It is I, fear not. But they being troubled and frighted, imagined they ſaw a Spirit. And he ſaith to them, Why are you troubled, and cogitations ariſe in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf, handle, and ſee: for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as you ſee me to have. And when he had ſaid this, he ſhewed them his hands and feet. But they yet not believing, and marvelling for joy, he ſaid, Have you here any thing to be eaten? But they offered him a piece of fiſh broiled, and a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comb. And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them, And he ſaid to them, Theſe are the words which I ſpake
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103432:116"/>to you when I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are writen in the Law of Moſes, and the Prophets, and the Pſalms, of me. Then he opened their underſtanding, that they might underſtand the Scriptures. And he ſaid to them, That ſo it is written, and ſo it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe again from the dead the third day, and penance to be preached in his Name, and remiſsion of ſins unto all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. WE think ſometimes that Jeſus is far from us, when he is in the midſt of our heart: he watches over us, and ſtretches out his divine hands for our protection. Let us live alwayes as if we were actually in his preſence, before his eyes, and in his boſome. An ancient Tradition doth obſerve, that after our Lords Aſcention, the Apoſtles did never eat together, but they left the firſt napkin, for their good Maſter conceiving that according to his promiſe, he was alwayes with them: Let us accuſtome our ſelves to this exerciſe of Gods preſence: It is a happy neceſſity to make us do well, to believe and apprehend that our Judge is alwayes preſent. I freſpect make him formidable, love will teach us that he is the Father of all ſweetneſs. There can be no greater comfort in this world, then to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103432:117"/>be preſent in heart and body with that which we love beſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus is taken by his Apoſtles for a Spirit, becauſe after the Reſurrection he pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the vvalls, and appeared ſuddenly as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith, in the ſecond to the Corinthians, that novv we do no more know Chriſt according to the fleſh, that is to ſay, by the paſſions of a mortall body, as Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth expound it. We muſt make little uſe of our bodies to converſe with our Jeſus, who hath taken upon him the rare qualities of a ſpirit. We muſt raiſe our ſelves above our ſenſes when we go to the Father of light, and the Creaton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Why are we ſo tyed to our ſenſe, and glued to the earth? Muſt we ſuffer our ſelves to enter into a kingdome of death, when we are told of the reſurr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. Admire the condeſcending and bounties of our Lord to his dear Diſciples. He that was entred into the kingdome of ſpirits, and immortall converſation, ſuffers his feet and hands to be touched, to prove in him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a true body. He eats in preſence of his Apoſtles, though he was not in more eſtate to digeſt meat, then the Sun is to digeſt vapours. He did no more nouriſh himſelf with our
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103432:117"/>corruptible meats, then the Stars do by the vapours of the earth. And yet he took them to confirm our belief, and to make us fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with him. It is the act of great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſpirits to abaſe themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to their inferiours. So <hi>David</hi> being anointed King, and inſpired as a Prophet, doth not ſhew his perſon terrible in the height of his great glory, but ſtill retained the mildneſſe of a Shepherd. So Ieſus the true Son of <hi>David</hi> (by his condſcending to us) hath conſecrated a certain degree, whereby we my aſcend to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <hi>THerefore when it was late that day the firſt of the Sabbaths, and the doors where ſhut, where the Diſciples were gathered together for fear of the Iews, Ieſus came and ſtood in the middeſt, and ſaid to them, Peace be to you.

But Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Ieſus came: the other Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples therefore ſaid to him, We have ſeen our Lord.

                  <p n="1">1. JEſus the Father of all bleſſed harmonies (after ſo many combats) makes a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peace in all nature. He pacifieth <hi>Limbo,</hi> taking the holy Fathers out of darkneſſe, to enjoy an eternall light, and ſending the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the bottom of hell. He pacifies the earth, making it from thenceforth to breathe the aire of his mercies. He pacifieth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, by delivering them from that profound ſadneſs, which they conceived by the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary loſſe of their dear Maſter. He pacifieth Heaven, by ſweetning the ſharpneſſe of his heavenly Father, quenching by his wounds, the fire which was kindled of his juſt anger. Every thing ſmileth upon this grear Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker: Nature leaveth her mourning, and putteth on her robes of chearfulneſs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with him his great and admirable conqueſts. It is in him that the heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (by a ſingular delight) hath poured out the fulneſſe of all Graces, to make us an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal dwelling, and to reconcile all in him and by him; pacifying by his bloud fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſs, all that is upon earth and in heaven. This is our <hi>Ioſuah</hi> of whom the Scripture ſpeaketh that he clears all difference, and appeaſeth all battels. No ſtroke of any hammer or other iron, was heard at the building of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; and behold the Church (which is the

Thoſe are the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which he hath engraved upon his fleſh, after a hundred ingenious faſhions. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies count their pearls and diamonds, but our Saviour counts his wounds, in the higheſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of his Magnificences. It is from thence, that the beauty of his body, taketh a new ſtate of glory, and our faith in the reſurrection is confirmed: that the good, fill themſelves with hope, Miſcreants with terrour, and Martyrs finde wherewith to enflame their courage. Theſe divine wounds open themſelves as ſo many mouths, to plead our cauſe before the Celeſtiall Father. Our Saviour Jeſus never ſpake better for us, then by the voice of his precious Bloud. Great enquity hath been made for thoſe mountains of mirth &amp; franking cence which <hi>Solomon</hi> promiſeth in the <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> but now we have found them in the wounds of Jeſus. It is from thence that there cometh forth a million of ſanctified exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſweetneſſe, of peace and propitiation as from an eternall ſanctuary. A man may ſay they are like the Carbuncle which melteth the wax upon which it is imprinted, for they melt our hears by a moſt profitable impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At this ſight the eternall Father calmes
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103432:120"/>his countenance, and the ſword of his juſtice returneth into the ſheath. Shall not we be worthy of all miſerie if we do arme theſe wounds againſt us, which are ſo effectuall in our behalf? And if this bloud of our <hi>Abel</hi> (after it hath reconciled his cruell executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) ſhould finde juſt matter to condemn us for our ingratitudes? <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſecond King of Portugall had made a ſecret vow, never to refuſe any thing which ſhould be asked of him in the virtue of our Saviours wounds; which made him give all his ſilver veſſels to a poor gentleman that had found out the word.
